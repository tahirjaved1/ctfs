# Basically we were given two file 

# One is vuln, it was exe file

# one was vuln.c source code of that exe file

# We can only get flag at shell server picoctf


# so for this we need to read source code, as it could accept only below 16 buffer value so it means we can overflow that

# by putting 17 buffer value. and eventually get the flag


# passs argument more than 16 characters
