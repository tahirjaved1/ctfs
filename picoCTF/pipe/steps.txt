# I was given only some 2018shell.picoctf.com 34532, I had to connect with this first
# This challenge was to save output after connecting with that service and port and save that output
# to a file and then get a flag from that file :)

# First i used that command

nc 2018shell.picoctf.com 34532 > flag.txt

# Then i got bunch of data in flag.txt
# simple grep this for flag and save into file flag.txt

cat flag.txt | grep -E "picoCTF{.*}"

cat flag.txt | grep -E "picoCTF{.*}" > flag.txt
