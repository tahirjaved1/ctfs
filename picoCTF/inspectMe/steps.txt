# I was given a webpage/ index.html file. I have to find flags.
# I just tried to browse, it was simple webpage and i tried to 
# see source code of that webpage by pressing 
ctrl+ u

# and I got picoCTF 1/3 in comment
# I can automate this

cat index.html | grep "picoCTF"

# Next I was trying ways to find other files linked to this domain # only

# I found one way to fetch every url, files etc

wget -mkEpnp -e robots=off http://2018shell.picoctf.com:28831/

#After this it was easy task to use cat and grep to find more
# 2/3 and 3/3 flag respectively with the word flag because
# it was duplicate in every file :)

cat index.html mycss.css myjs.js | grep "flag"
