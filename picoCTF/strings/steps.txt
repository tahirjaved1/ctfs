# I was given a file and When i checked from file command it was executable.

# I can't run this file so for this I need to do some hit and trial methods like cat etc

# I did this

cat stings

# but failed and I was not finding anything useful, then did this too

cat string | grep -E "picoCTF{.*}"

# but still failed to get something

# so finally I remembered it is an exe file so we can get strings of that exe file so that a human can read this text inside that exe file

# strings is basically a utility which helps us to see human readable text inside exe file otherwise human will not be able to read exe text

# finally 

strings strings | grep -E "picoCTF{.*}"
