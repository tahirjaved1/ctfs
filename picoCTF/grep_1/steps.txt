# we were given a file, that were simple text file
# check it by

file file

# then i just simply grep this file for picoCTF word with this command

cat file | grep -E "picoCTF{.*}" 

# -E for regular expressions
#The .* characters, in a regular expression like this mean “match any 
#number of any characters”, so the pattern here says “match the word picoCTF followed by a
#{, followed by any characters until you find a }”.
